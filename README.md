### hello
i'm moving all of my active development to codeberg, at [codeberg.org/periwinkle](https://codeberg.org/periwinkle). i will keep all existing projects on this account, and likely continue to use it to contribute to other github-hosted projects. 

see why i decided to make the hop at [GiveUpGithub.org](https://giveupgithub.org).
